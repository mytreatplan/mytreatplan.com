  summary: The browser test `signup/tests/browser/test_failure_policies.py::test_row5_email_in_a_pending_registration` is flaky in CI (page URL not yet /en/signup/legal/ when asserted).
  evidence: Failed in PR #49's CI run 41034239589 and passed on re-run with no code change; unrelated to the diff (deploy tooling only).
